**Overview**

This project investigates the correlation between missing persons, unidentified remains, and unclaimed remains, with a particular focus on the cave systems in the Appalachia region. By analyzing data on missing people and remains in this area, the project aims to uncover any potential links between these cases and the region's extensive cave networks. Our goal was to identify patterns or connections that might suggest the cave systems play a role in the disappearance of individuals or the discovery of unidentified remains. This research could provide valuable insights into the complex nature of these cases and their relationship with the terrain of Appalachia.

Additionally, the project aims to contribute to ongoing efforts to locate missing individuals, identify unidentified remains, and help bring closure to families. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding regional geography and its impact on cases of missing persons, with the goal of improving investigative methods in the future.

**Ethical Considerations**

During this project, it was critical to make ethical considerations due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter. Ensuring privacy and confidentiality is essential when working with data related to missing persons and remains. We prioritize the protection of any personally identifiable information (PII) and adhere to ethical data handling practices, including anonymizing data wherever possible. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining respect for the dignity of individuals involved, recognizing the emotional impact on families and communities.
    
It was our goal to perform analysis focused on providing insights that may help authorities and organizations, while ensuring the humane treatment of individuals impacted by these issues. The ethical implications of using such data are considered carefully throughout the research process to ensure that the project benefits society without causing harm or distress.
